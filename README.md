### Continued development

I'm so glad I completed this amazing challenge! I've learned a lot along the way and I feel my development has benefited from this challenging project. While it took a little longer than expected due to my familiarity with some technology, I'm thrilled to finally have it done!

I faced several challenges during the project, especially regarding organization, which was a challenging aspect to maintain. However, I believe I managed to do a good job in this regard. It was my first time working on such a large project with multiple technologies, which made it difficult to organize everything and keep the code clean. Even so, I'm confident I did a good job!
